# Coursera Capstone

A repo for my Capstone Project for IBM's Data Science Certificate


## Introduction

Everyone has that beloved special food spot. Whether it’s a small burger joint, or a large family restaurant with the best mashed potatoes. We each have a special restaurant that fondly warms our belly.  

The question is, which city in Orange County has the most of these wonderfully delicious places? 

I want to set out on a journey to find out which community in Orange County, California is home to the most, most delicious restaurants. 

## Data

I plan to use FourSquare's Places API, along with geographical data to tackle this problem. Using geographical data, like the coordinates of city centers and size of each city, I will build areas in which to search. I will utilize FourSquare’s Places API to search within those areas and build a list of restaurants and ratings.
